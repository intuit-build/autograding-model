image::summary.png[Scores, width="100%"]

Java library that autogrades projects based on a configurable set of metrics. Currently, you can select from the
following metrics:

- Test statistics (e.g., number of failed tests)
- Code coverage (e.g., line coverage percentage)
- PIT mutation coverage (e.g., missed mutations' percentage)
- Static analysis (e.g., number of warnings)

For each metric you can define the impact on the overall score and the individual scoring criteria.
